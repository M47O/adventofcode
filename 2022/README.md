# Advent of Code

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small
> programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved
> in any programming language you like.

This is a repo containing my solutions to the coding challenges found in [Eric Wastl's](https://was.tl/) **Advent of Code**.
All of my solutions are written in JavaScript and are meant to be run in a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) environment. 

By no means do I profess my answers to these problems tht be most performant, most creative, or the best in any shape or form. 
As such, I am eager to hear criticisms, improvements, or answer any questions regarding my solutions.
